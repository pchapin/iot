# IoT Body of Knowledge

This repository contains my sandbox of IoT experiments and learning exercises. If any of this
code ever matures to a reasonable place, it could potentially be moved to its own repository.

Some of this material was created in support of IoT classes I taught at Vermont State
University. For example, the BeaglePlay folder contains a simple project for gathering
(simulated) temperature data in the Winooski Valley of Vermont, uploading that data to a cloud
database, and then analyzing it using a simple machine learning method to build a model of how
temperatures in that region vary on a daily basis. For more information, see the README.md file
in the BeaglePlay folder.

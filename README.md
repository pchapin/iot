# IoT Body of Knowledge

This repository contains my sandbox of IoT experiments and learning exercises. If any of this
code ever matures to a reasonable place, it could potentially be moved to its own repository.

+ **SensorNet**. A wireless sensor network that gathers temperature data around the Williston
  campus of Vermont State University. This project uses WSN nodes (Tmote Sky) and the nesC
  programming language.
  
+ **TempVT**. A temperature gathering application for the BeaglePlay that simulates acquiring
  temperature data in the Winoosky River Valley of Vermont. This project is written in Python
  with an alternate implementation (partial) in C. It was used as an in-class example for a
  second-year IoT class at Vermont State University.

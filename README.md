# IoT Body of Knowledge

This repository contains my sandbox of IoT experiments and learning exercises. If any of this
code ever matures to a reasonable place, it could potentially be moved to its own repository.

Some of this material is solutions to programming assignments given to my IoT Programming
students. Because of that, this repository is private for now.
